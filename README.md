# Configuration

## Running the Mock-Up

To run the mock up make sure you open these two links
- Frontend: https://phase3-mockup-frontend.vercel.app/
- Backend: https://phase3-mockup-server.vercel.app/ 

## Common Issues
- It is being ran from my mongodb account so if there are any issues with registering / adding a new user it is most likely caused by.
- If there is a CORS error, make sure you wait till the backend (server) page is opened to establish connection.
- If you run into a ERR_BAD_REQUEST it means that the account already exists in the database.
